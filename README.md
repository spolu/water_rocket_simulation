# Water Rocket Simulation

This project simulates the physics of a water rocket to help with design and performance analysis. It models the key physical processes including:

- Water expulsion phase
- Air expansion and pressure dynamics
- Aerodynamic drag
- Gravitational effects
- Flight trajectory

## Features

- Simulate complete flight trajectory
- Analyze performance with different water volumes
- Visualize altitude, velocity, and acceleration profiles
- Optimize rocket design parameters

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Dependencies listed in requirements.txt

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
python src/main.py
```

## Configuration

Edit the parameters in `config.py` to customize your rocket design:
- Bottle volume
- Water fill percentage
- Nozzle diameter
- Initial pressure
- Rocket mass
- Drag coefficient
